# odin-recipes
First project of Odin.
This project will demonstrate my skills working with HTML. This includes setting up a homepage, imbedding links and images, organizing the page using lists,and using proper headings. This project will also help practice using the command line as well as working with github to commit/save my project. Will reflect more once the project is complete.
